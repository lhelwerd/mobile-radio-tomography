Some usage notes for VRML files:
- There are VRML files at http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/demo_models.php
  that can be used to simulate environments. There aren't that many, but there
  are interesting ones such as vrml_2/castle.wrl, shadow_maps/trees_river.wrl,
  sensors_environmental/deranged_house.wrl (indoor), etc.
- Certain files use nonstandard/unsupported/new features that cause the VRML
  parser to give up. The solution is to remove the entire node that the parser
  mentions as problematic, since it is a feature that we do not use.
- One can export scene files in Blender (http://www.blender.org/) using an
  addon that is provided with the download, but not enabled by default. Go to
  File -> User Preferences -> Add-ons -> Categories: Import-Export and scroll
  down to the VRML2 addon. Check the box next to it and save the settings.
  One can import PLY, OBJ, Autodesk 3D Studio (somewhat open/standard formats)
  or X3D files (the followup of VRML) and then export them to VRML in this way.
  Note that this might lose certain information, but we only use the bare
  polygon coordinate information, so that is no problem. It does seem that
  the orientation of the scene is sometimes altered.

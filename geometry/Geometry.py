    Geometry utility methods.

    This is a class with methods that calculate distances, locations or angles
    based on specific input.

    Note that some methods assume certain properties of the earth's surface, 
    such as it being spherical or being flat. Depending on these assumptions, 
    these functions may have different accuracies across distances. Different
    subclasses make different assumptions about the geometry.
    Note that (`y`,`x`) = (`lat`,`lon`) = (`N`,`E`).

    The base class does use meters as the base unit for coordinates, and works
    only with `LocationLocal` objects and the local frame of `Locations` objects
    from the `dronekit` library. The third coordinate in `LocationLocal` is
    calculated downward from the origin altitude, although in some methods we
    convert this to an upward altitude coordinate for consistency with the two
    other location objects.

    Use `Geometry_Spherical` for geographic coordinates on a spherical earth.

    Synchronized traveling salesmen's tasks assignment problem algorithm.

    We use a greedy strategy to appoint a number of vehicles to visit a number
    of waypoint pairs. It does not matter which vehicle visits which waypoint,
    but each waypoint within a pair must be visited by different vehicles at the
    same moment in time (or they have to wait for the other vehicle to arrive).
    We want to minimize the time loss due to this synchronization as well as
    the time needed to visit the waypoint pairs, which can be done in any order.

    The time is calculated using the Manhattan distance in this class. Other
    implementations could add in the time needed for turning and synchronization
    or use a different distance function.

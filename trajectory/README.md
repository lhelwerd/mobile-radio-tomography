# DroneKit mission scripts

This repository contains a number of mission scripts that are based on the 
[DroneKit SDK](http://python.dronekit.io/). Some of these scripts are based 
on the example scripts from the DroneKit core code. The latest versions and 
commit history of these scripts can be found in the master repository at 
https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python/tree/master/examples.

The example scripts from DroneKit are available under the
[Apache Licence 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html), which is 
compatible with the GNU General Public Licence version 3 in the sense that we 
can distribute it under the latter license. See the LICENSE file in the main

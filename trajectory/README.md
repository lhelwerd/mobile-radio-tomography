# DroneKit mission scripts

This repository contains a number of mission scripts that are based on the 
[DroneKit SDK](http://python.dronekit.io/). Some of these scripts are based 
on the example scripts from the DroneKit core code. The latest versions and 
commit history of these scripts can be found in the master repository at 
https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python/tree/master/examples.

class MAVLink_Vehicle(Vehicle):
    """
    A vehicle that supports some parts of the MAVLink protocol, e.g.,
    mission command sequences or other command message parsing.

    In addition to the interface enforced by `Vehicle`, this class requires that
    the following properties and methods exist with semantics:
    - `commands`: A `CommandSequence`-like object, as described in
      http://python.dronekit.io/automodule.html#dronekit.CommandSequence
    - `flush`: A method that might perform backend changes for update_mission,
      but can also be a no-op if no backend changes are necessary in this case.
    - `location`: A read-only property, that returns the current location of
      the vehicle as a `Locations` object. Other types are not allowed, although
      the returned `Locations` may have frames with invalid locations.

    Of course, all abstract methods from `Vehicle` must also be implemented.

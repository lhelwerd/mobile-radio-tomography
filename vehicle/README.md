# Vehicle classes

This module contains interfaces for various vehicle types that allow the 
missions and other components to communicate with a vehicle backend. The 
classes may be wrappers around these backends or contain the internal state 
themselves. Various types of vehicles are supported with support for most of 
the necessities, such as current location and other vehicle state, waypoint 
mission commands, and adjusting speed or other properties. Some vehicles also 
support simulation.
